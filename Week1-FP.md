## Hints
### Hint 1
For testing, you want to insert two values into the `heap`, for example with:

```scala
forAll { (x: Int, y: Int) => 
}
```

When you add the values into the heap and search for the minimum `findMin`, it would be handy
to know whether `x` or `y` is the smallest, the following will help:

```scala
scala> def order = scala.math.Ordering.Int
order: math.Ordering.Int.type

scala> order.min(2,1)
res0: Int = 1
```

The heap has the method `ord` that does the same.

### Hint 2
To generate a heap, you can use the following code:

```scala
lazy val genHeap: Gen[H] = for {
    n <- arbitrary[Int]
    h <- oneOf(empty, genHeap)
  } yield insert(n, h)
```

### Hint 3
Did you notice the following? We have three methods, `isEmpty`, `findMin` and `deleteMin`. When you combine these
methods you can `iterate` over the heap until its empty and put the contents into a list:

```scala
 def heapToList(h: H): List[Int] =
    if(isEmpty(h)) Nil else findMin(h) :: heapToList(deleteMin(h))
```

Lists can be sorted:

```scala
scala> val xs = List(2,3,1,5,6,2,3,4,0,1,2)
xs: List[Int] = List(2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2)

scala> xs.sorted
res0: List[Int] = List(0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```

Lists can also be compared:

```scala
scala> List(1, 2) == List(1, 2)
res0: Boolean = true
              
scala> List(1, 2) == List(2, 1)
res1: Boolean = false

scala> List(1, 2) == List(2, 1).sorted
res2: Boolean = true

scala> List(2, 1).sorted == List(2, 1).sorted
res3: Boolean = true
```
